# spotify-slack-status
An Automator script that changes your Slack status to the music you're listening to

## How does it work?

This app is just a wrapper around a script based on [this gist](https://gist.github.com/jgamblin/9701ed50398d138c65ead316b5d11b26)
It's made for non-technical users :)

- First, get a **Spotify API key** (it'll be used to access what you're listening to). You can get one [here](https://api.slack.com/custom-integrations/legacy-tokens)
- Once you've got the API key, **copy it** (it will be automatically pasted when you open the app)
- Double-click on the `Spotify Slack Status` app
- Check that your API key is alright & validate
- You will see a spinning wheel in your Mac's menu bar (on the top of the screen)
